Hi my name is Steve.

I am currently an Electrical Engineering student who has become quite interested in the world of software.
My goal is to utilize my ability to understand hardware with my passion for programming in the future, careerwise.

Presently I have been obsessed with learning and practicing python in my free time.

I hope to collaborate on projects through this github platform and to figure out what else github has to offer me as the user.

Feel free to contact me about opportunities for internships or if you would like to chat and/or discuss or work on some coding project, please contact me as well.

I am a programming novice who has some knowledge in C, C++ programming and web development.

Welcome to my Github page!
